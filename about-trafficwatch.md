# About TrafficwatchNI

Transport NI of the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland and has responsibility for the management of traffic on all public roads. This TrafficwatchNI site is provided by Transport NI to relay traffic information to the public. The site provides traffic bulletins, roadworks reports, and access to the images from some of our traffic cameras.

Currently only eighteen cameras are available for public viewing, however, over time, we hope to increase the number of camera images available to the public and also to further enhance our provision of travel information.
