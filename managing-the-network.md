# Managing the Network

The economy of Northern Ireland is heavily dependant upon the road network. As the demand for travel continues to increase, Transport NI is increasingly using Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) to maximise the capacity of the existing road infrastructure.

	
Over the past 10 years, our application of ITS has included:

* Extending and upgrading our motoway control systems and facilities.
* Introducing "Managed Motorways" on part of the M1 and A12 Westlink.
* Extending the area of SCOOT / UTC traffic control in urban areas.
* Applying UTMC (Urban Traffic Management & Control) good practice.
* Instaling MOVA (Microprocessor Optimised Vehicle Actuated), and linked MOVA control at appropriate junctions.
	
* Installing Busways on some sections of motorway hard shoulders.
* Providing real time information for public transport passengers and priority at traffic signals for buses.
* Establishing a Datex 2 data transmission link for exchanging information with other Traffic Control Centres.
* Establishing a satellite UTC system in Craigavon.
	
* Continuing to install traffic signals and controlled crossings.
* Installing and commissioning the Foyle Bridge Safety Management System.
* Installing a network of ANPR cameras for journey time estimation.
* Continuing to install roadside variable message signs.
* Developed a Joint Protocol with the police for the Management of Incidents.
